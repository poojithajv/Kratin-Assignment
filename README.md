My name is Janapati Venkata Poojitha. I’m from Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh. I have completed my master’s in Applied Mechanics in 2022 with a CGPA of 8.9 from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad. I developed my interest in coding and software after my studies. So, I decided to pursue a career in IT. I found out about CCBP when I was looking for courses online to learn coding. So, I started my learning journey with CCBP intensive 4.0 program to build strong programming skills and make a good career for myself. By learning this program, I got hands-on-experience with various technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and SQLite. Out of all these, I am strong in Python, HTML, and CSS. I developed many static, responsive and dynamic websites. I really enjoyed developing website for to-do lists. By using this website, the user can make a list of their daily tasks. After completing each task, they can mark it as done and also delete it. This will help them keep a track of their progress. I practiced coding consistently every day for 6 to 7 hours. 
I am passionate about technology. With my knowledge and skills, I believe I can contribute well to my company to make people’s lives better. I am open to learning continuously in my role.

Here are some general suggestions for seniors like Sunitha Sharma to live a healthy and happy life:

Maintain Sunitha's physical and mental well-being by encouraging her to engage in frequent physical activity, such as walking, yoga, or swimming.
Consume a well-balanced diet: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein can help to prevent a variety of health concerns. Additionally, make certain that Sunitha is drinking enough water and staying hydrated.
Keep Mind Active: Encourage Sunitha to keep her mind engaged by performing crossword puzzles, reading books, or acquiring new skills.
Maintain contact with family and friends: Social isolation can lead to depression and other health issues. Urge Sunitha to maintain in-person or virtual contact with family and friends.
Have regular health check-ups: Sunitha must undergo regular health check-ups with her doctor in order to monitor any health problems and address them as soon as possible.
Handle stress: Encourage Sunitha to engage in stress-relieving activities such as meditation or yoga, which can assist her in dealing with stress and maintaining mental well-being.
Be safe: Make sure Sunitha is taking the essential safety precautions, such as wearing a seatbelt while driving, utilising mobility aids as needed, and taking efforts to avoid falls.



One use case for elderly care that comes to mind is a smart home system that helps elderly people manage their daily routines and keep them safe.

The following functionalities would be included in the functioning prototype that I propose:

1. Virtual assistant that responds to voice commands: The smart home system would have a voice-activated virtual assistant, similar to Amazon's Alexa or Google Home. It can help the elderly person with chores like setting reminders, making phone calls, and listening to music without the need for a smartphone or computer.

2. Medication management: The smart home device would remind the elderly person to take their medication and log when they had done so. If the medication is not taken, it will notify the carer or emergency services.

3. Fall detection and emergency response: In the home, a motion sensor would be fitted to determine if the elderly person had fallen. If a fall is detected, the system will automatically notify a caregiver or emergency services, requesting immediate assistance.

4. Smart lighting: The technology will alter the lighting in the home automatically to guarantee that the older person has appropriate lighting and can avoid falls.

5. Remote monitoring: The system would allow carers or family members to remotely watch the old person's activity and receive alerts in the event of any unusual activity or an emergency.
